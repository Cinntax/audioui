audioui
=======

Meteor application to manage pulseaudio.
The goal to this application is to allow the user to be able to control routings between multiple pulseaudio sources (ie. multiple mpd servers, airplay instances, upnp renderers, etc), and multiple sinks (a 7.1 sound card chopped up into 4x2 channel zones via module-remap-sink).

Ultimately the goal would be to create an appliance distribution completely configurable via a web console. This would be part of that distribution.
